The orders of growth of the space is linear (O(n)) in relation to the change input argument, 
because at each recursive step, we need to keep track of our current position in the tree 
and how to get to the root of the tree. The maximum tree depth is n.

As the amount to be changed increases, the number of steps increases by some constant times
n.
